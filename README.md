<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
My grandfather really likes to collect Chinese porcelain as his hobby until the living room at my house is full of his Chinese porcelain collection. But as I see a lot of kids in my generation nowadays are not really familiar with Chinese porcelain including my friend when I invite him to my house he said it's his first-time look at Chinese porcelain.

So I create a solution an iPad app that introduces about Chinese porcelain and let you create your own Chinese porcelain with 3 types of shapes and 3 types of painting for each shape that can make a 9 different result of Chinese porcelain with an explanation for the steps. Also, thereâ€™s a mascot I create named Mei-mei she will accompany you throughout the app. All the explanations and user interfaces are made simple and fun so people do not get bored easily when learning about Chinese porcelain.

## About The Project
All of the design and illustration assets are self-made by using the software Adobe Illustration and the information delivery in this app is a result of self-study by asking the people who are familiar with Chinese porcelain and self-study on the internet.
